# #      ACTIVITY 1

# # Working with Numbers
# pi = 3.14
# print(pi)
# #can do math operations in a print
# firstNum = 9
# secondNum = 2
# print(firstNum + secondNum)
# #this can be done with any operation /*-+
# print(firstNum ** secondNum) #a double ** means exponent like 2 to the power of

# # you cant print more than one type of variable
# print(28 + 'days in february')# THIS WONT WORK

#Type conversion
# str() converts the var inside to a string
print(str(28) + ' days in feb')
# int() converts the var inside to a whole number, can only use whole numbers
print(int('29'))
# float() converts the var inside to a number that can have decimals
print(int('2.9'))
